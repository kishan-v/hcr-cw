✅Supported ⚠️Partial support ❌Not supported ⏳In development

## Supported Platforms
Supported .NET Versions:
- .NET 7
- .NET 8

Supported ROS 2 Distributions:
- Iron Irwini
- Humble Hawksbill
- Foxy Fitzroy

Supported Operating Systems:
- Ubuntu
- Windows

Should also work on macOS but untested.

## Getting Started
rclnet provides project templates to help you getting started quickly. You can install the templates using the following command:
```
dotnet new install Rcl.NET.Templates
```

Then, to create a node application:
```
mkdir MyNode
cd MyNode
dotnet new ros2-node
```

To create a message only library:
```
mkdir MyMessageLibrary
cd MyMessageLibrary
dotnet new ros2-msg
```

If you prefer creating the projects by yourself, or want to use rclnet in existing projects,
refer the [Installing](#Installing) and [Generating Messages](#Generating-Messages) section.

## Installing
Stable releases of rclnet are hosted on NuGet. You can install them using the following command:
```
dotnet add package Rcl.NET
```

For message only projects, you can install only `Rosidl.Runtime` without `Rcl.NET`:
```
dotnet add package Rosidl.Runtime
```

To generate message classes, you'll also need to install `ros2cs` utility:
```
dotnet tool install -g ros2cs
```

## Generating Messages
rclnet does not ship with message definitions. In order to communicate with other ROS 2 nodes,
you need to generate messages first.

Message definitions are .NET classes / structs, you can either include messages in a console app
which runs as an ROS 2 node, or compile separately in another library.

Projects containing messages will have to meet the following requirements:
- `Rcl.NET` or `Rosidl.Runtime` NuGet package is installed.
- `AllowUnsafeBlocks` is set to `true`. This can be done by adding the following lines to the `.csproj` file:
    ```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
        <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```
- Runtime marshalling for the assembly is disabled. You can add the following line to somewhere in the source code of the project:
    ```csharp
    [assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DisableRuntimeMarshalling]
    ```

To generate messages, you also need to add a `ros2cs.spec` file to somewhere in the project (usually the project root).
A `ros2cs.spec` file contains configurations such as output directory and where to find packages,
see [here](https://github.com/noelex/rclnet/blob/main/src/ros2cs/ros2cs.spec) for detailed explanations.

Assuming you've already installed the `ros2cs` utility, simply run the following command to generate messages:
```
ros2cs /path/to/ros2cs.spec
```

### Configuring Message Generation Using Command-line Arguments
Starting from v1.3.0, ros2cs supports specifying message generation options using command-line arguments. You can
configure message generation using command-line arguments in conjunction with ros2cs.spec files.

```
Usage:  ros2cs <OPTIONS> <SPEC_FILE>

Generates C# source code from ROS2 interface definitions for use with Rcl.NET.

OPTIONS:
    --service-introspection,
    --no-service-introspection
        Generate code for service introspection.

        This feature requires 'service_msgs' package.
        This option is disabled by default.

    --action-details,
    --no-action-details
        Generate implementation details for actions, including FeedbackMessage, SendGoal
        request/response and GetResult request/response.
        Detail messages are not neccesary for using action servers and clients as rclnet
        utilizes introspection to construct and extract Feedback / Goal and Result messages.
        Enabling 'action-details' will allow you to perform service introspection on Result
        and Goal services, or manually subscribe Feedback messages, at the cost of increased
        code size.

        This feature requires 'unique_identifier_msgs' and 'builtin_interfaces' package.
        This option is disabled by default.

    --internal,
    --no-internal
        Generate classes with internal visibility rather than public.

        This option is disabled by default.

    --from-ament-index,
    --no-ament-index
        Read packages from ament prefix directories as specified by AMENT_PREFIX_PATH.
        If this flag specified, ament prefix directories always load before all other
        'from-directory' directives.

        This option is disabled by default.

    --ignore-missing,
    --no-ignore-missing
        Ignore missing included and depedency packages, proceed with packages currently
        available anyway.

        By default, ros2cs will abort with exit code 1 if any package dependency is missing,
        unless missing packages are excluded explicitly using 'exclude' option.
        Enabling this option forces ros2cs to generate code even if some packages are missing.

        This option is disabled by default.

    -o,
    --output=OUTPUT_DIR
        Specifiy the output directory.
        A path relative to the SPEC_FILE (if not specified, relative to current directory),
        or an absolute path can be used.

    -I,
    --from-directory=INCLUDE_DIR
        Read packages from specified root package directory containing one or more packages.
        A path relative to this file or an absolute path can be used.

        This option may be specified multiple times.

    -n,
    --namespace=NAMESPACE
        Set the default root namespace of the generated code.

    -i,
    --include="PKG1 PKG2 ..."
        Generate codes for specified packages only.
        Dependencies of the specified packages will also be included recursively.
        If no include directive is specified, ros2cs will generate codes for all discovered
        packages.

        This option may be specified multiple times.

    -e,
    --exclude="PKG1 PKG2 ..."
        Explicitly exclude packages from code generation.

        This option may be specified multiple times.

    --map-namespace=PKG:NAMESPACE
        Set the root namespace of a specific package,
        e.g. '--map-name my_messages:My.Namespace' will map definitions in package 'my_messages'
        into C# namespace My.Namespace.MyMessages.
        If not specified, default root namespace is used.

        This option may be specified multiple times.

    --map-name=PKG:NAME
        Set the name of a specific package,
        e.g. 'map-name my_messages:Messages' will map definitions in package 'my_messages'
        into C# namespace Rosidl.Messages.Messages.
        If not specified, ros2cs will determine the package name automatically.

        This option may be specified multiple times.

    -v,
    --version
        Print the version of this program.

    -h,
    --help
        Print this message.

SPEC_FILE:
    Path to a ros2cs spec file containing configurations for generating source code.

    If neither OPTIONS nor SPEC_FILE is specified, ros2cs will try to use 'ros2cs.spec'
    in current directory as SPEC_FILE.

    If both OPTIONS and SPEC_FILE are specified, ros2cs will load configurations from
    SPEC_FILE first, and override configurations with options specified by OPTIONS.
```

## Asynchronous Execution Model
Unlike rclcpp and rclpy, rclnet doesn't have the concept of executors. Each `RclContext` runs its
own event loop for waiting on signals and dispatching callbacks, which is essentialy a single-threaded
executor.

Although rclnet does not provide multi-threaded executors, it doesn't mean that you can't process messages or handle
service requests using multiple threads. All communication primitives in rclnet provide both synchronous
and asynchronous APIs for different needs and scenarios.

Synchronous APIs are simpler and faster if the work need to be done is simple enough, e.g. neither CPU-intensive nor needs to issue blocking calls. Asynchronous APIs, in contrast, are for scenarios where you need to perform asynchronous calls or
offload blocking operations into background threads.

Take subscriptions for example, you can receive messages synchronously using `IRclSubscription<T>.Subscribe`,
or asynchronously using `IRclSubscription<T>.ReadAllAsync`. Synchronous subscriptions always handle messages
on the event loop. While for asynchronous subscriptions, you can choose where you'd like to process the received
messages:

```csharp
await foreach (var msg in sub.ReadAllAsync())
{
    // Perform asynchronous operation.
    await SomeAsyncOperation(msg);

    // Perform synchronous operation and wait for its completion without blocking the event loop.
    await Task.Run(() => SomeOffloadedSyncOperation(msg));
}
```

In the above example, the event loop of the `RclContext` is used for listening to events only. Where are the messages
handled depends on the `SynchronizationContext` currently captured.

If there's no `SynchronizationContext` in use, event handling happens in background threads by default. Otherwise, the
events will be handled in the captured `SynchronizationContext`. If you are using rclnet inside a GUI application,
this usually means that the events are handled on the UI thread.

`RclContext`s can also have their own `SynchronizationContext`s, which always schedule asynchronous operations on the event loop.
This is extremely helpful if you want to introduce single-threaded concurrency into your application:

```csharp
await using var context = new RclContext(useSynchronizationContext: true);

...

// Enforce execution on the event loop so that we can capture its SynchronizationContext.
await context.Yield();

// All following awaits will resume on the event loop by default.
await foreach (var msg in sub.ReadAllAsync())
{
    // On event loop.
    await SomeAsyncOperation(msg);
    // On event loop.
    await Task.Run(() => {
        // On thread pool.
        SomeOffloadedSyncOperation(msg);
    });
    // On event loop.
    await Task.Yield();
    // On event loop.

    // We can also spin up multiple coroutines to run concurrently on the event loop.
    Task task1 = Coroutine1Async(msg),
         task2 = Coroutine2Async(msg);

    // Or asynchronously wait for all coroutines to complete.
    await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);

    ...

    // The execution of current async method will stay on the event
    // loop unless we break out of the SynchronizationContext using
    // ConfigureAwait(false), or RclContext.YieldBackground().

    await AnotherAsyncOperation(msg).ConfigureAwait(false);
    // On thread pool thread.

    // We can still transition back to the event loop with context.Yield().

    await context.Yield();
    // On event loop.

    await RclContext.YieldBackground();
    // On thread pool thread.
}
```

As shown in the above example, besides of `SynchronizationContext`, you can also use `RclContext.Yield`, `RclContext.YieldBackground` and `ConfigureAwait(false)` to perform fine-grained control
over the asynchronous exection flow.

### Additional Notes about `IRclWaitObject.WaitOneAsync`
Timers and guard conditions created by `RclContext` implements `IRclWaitObject` interface,
which allow the caller to asynchronously wait for the signal.

`IRclWaitObject` interface exposes the following two overloads of `WaitOneAsync`:
```csharp
ValueTask WaitOneAsync(bool runContinuationAsynchronously, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
ValueTask WaitOneAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```
The latter overload simply calls another one with `runContinuationAsynchronously` set to `true`.

`WaitOneAsync` allows the caller to explicitly control the execution of the continuation via `runContinuationAsynchronously`
parameter. Assuming there's no captured `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler`, when `runContinuationAsynchronously`
is set to `true`, the continuation will be scheduled to execute in thread pool. And if `runContinuationAsynchronously`
is set to `false`, the continuation is guaranteed to execute on the event loop.

However, when a `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler` is captured, the continuation of the call to `WaitOneAsync`
will always execute in the captured context, regardless of the value of `runContinuationAsynchronously`.

Since context capture can be suppressed by calling `ConfigureAwait` with `continueOnCapturedContext` set to `false`,
execution of the continuation can be precisely controlled using `runContinuationAsynchronously` in conjunction with
`continueOnCapturedContext`.


| `runContinuationAsynchronously` | `continueOnCapturedContext` | Continuation Execution                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`                          | `true`                      | Captured `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler` if any, thread pool otherwise |
| `true`                          | `false`                     | Thread pool                                                                        |
| `false`                         | `true`                      | Captured `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler` if any, event loop otherwise  |
| `false`                         | `false`                     | Event loop                                                                         |

## Building and Running Examples

The following instruction assumes that you've already installed ROS 2 foxy or humble in your system.

You'll need .NET 8.0 SDK to build and run the examples, see instructions 
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu).

Make sure you have all dependencies installed by running:
```
rosdep install -i --from-paths examples
```

### Run with `dotnet run`
Now you can run example projects using `dotnet run`, e.g.
```
dotnet run examples/turtle_rotate
```

### Run with `ros2 run`
Or you can build and install examples as colcon packages:
```
colcon build --executor sequential --merge-install --paths examples/*
source install/setup.bash
```

To run an example node, use `ros2 run`, e.g.
```
ros2 run graph_monitor graph_monitor
```
