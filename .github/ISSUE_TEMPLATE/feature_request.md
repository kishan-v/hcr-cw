# **[Feature Title Here]**

## **Sub-System**
*e.g. rover control*

## **Feature Description**
*Provide a detailed description of the feature being added.*  
Example: Implement a path-planning algorithm to enable autonomous navigation through a mapped environment. The feature will integrate sensor data to avoid obstacles and update robot routes dynamically.

## **Justification for Feature**
*Explain why this feature is necessary and how it benefits the project.*  
Example: This feature is essential to enhance the robot's autonomy, reduce manual intervention, and improve mission efficiency. It also aligns with the project goals of achieving seamless robot movement in dynamic environments.

## **Additional Context**
*Include any supporting details, references, or resources to aid development.*  
Example: Refer to the project documentation on sensor API usage. Consider using existing libraries like [LibraryName] for pathfinding algorithms. This feature should be tested in simulation before deployment to the physical robot.
