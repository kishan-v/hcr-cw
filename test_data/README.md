## Test Data
 
### Trust Perception - Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The **HRI Questionnaire** was used to assess participants' trust and perception of the two navigation methods: the **Virtuix controller** and the **Handheld controller**. The responses were collected across multiple questions, focusing on user comfort, ease of use, and overall preference.

The results indicate that participant responses varied between the two systems, with some favoring the **Virtuix controller** for immersion, while others found the **Handheld controller** more intuitive. Further analysis is needed to determine how trust in the system is affected by these factors.
 
### Virtual Reality Immersion (VRI)
The **Virtual Reality Immersion (VRI) questionnaire** measured the perceived level of immersion between the two navigation methods. Participants rated aspects such as **sensory engagement, imaginative immersion, and spatial presence**.

The **Virtuix controller consistently scored higher in immersion-related metrics**, suggesting that the system provides a more engaging virtual experience. However, the **Handheld controller had more stable scores**, indicating a more consistent user experience across participants.
 
### NASA Task Load Index (TLX)
The **NASA TLX** was administered to evaluate the cognitive and physical workload associated with each navigation method. Participants rated dimensions such as **Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Effort, and Frustration**.

![NASA TLX Scores](NASA_TLX_Scores_Virtuix_vs_Handheld.png)
 
The results show **no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) across most categories**, suggesting that the workload between the two systems is comparable. However, **Effort and Physical Demand scores were slightly higher for the Virtuix controller**, indicating that the system may require more physical exertion.
 
### Task Completion Time
Task completion times were recorded for each participant across different conditions. The **Virtuix controller** and **Handheld controller** were tested in two orders:  
1. **Virtuix first, then Joystick**  
2. **Joystick first, then Virtuix**  
 
![Task Completion Time](Task_Completion_Time.png)
 
The results indicate that **completion time decreased** when a system was used for the second time, suggesting **a learning effect**. However, participants who used the **Virtuix controller first had longer completion times** compared to those who started with the **Handheld controller**, indicating a **steeper initial learning curve for the Virtuix system**.

### **Conclusion**
The collected data provides insights into **immersion, workload, trust perception, and performance efficiency** for the two VR navigation methods. While the **Virtuix controller enhances immersion**, it may require **greater physical effort and adaptation time**. The **Handheld controller offers a more consistent experience**, though some users reported higher **motion sickness**. Future research should expand the participant pool and introduce additional cognitive tasks to **further explore the cognitive and physical demands of each system**.
